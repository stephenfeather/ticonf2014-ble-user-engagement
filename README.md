## Demo Apps for the TiConf 2014 Presentation 'Using BLE to Enhance User Engagement'

#### A Quick Note 
I want to thank Joe Beuckman whose TiBeacons module first opened the door for BLE PXP access on the Titanium platform. The examples simply enhance his his well documented module and sample app to physically demonstate a few scenarios. Be sure to follow  him on twitter at [@joebeuckman](https://twitter.com/joebeuckman) and take a look at his [github repo](https://github.com/jbeuckm)
